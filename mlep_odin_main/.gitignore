# ---------- FILE TYPES ----------------------
# Ignore python compiled files
*.pyc
# Ignore binary and word embedding files (generated from gensim, e.g.)
*.bin
# Remove IDE specific files
.vscode
# Ignore csv files generated from application.py
*.csv
# An apikey file containing an apikey
apikey
# Ignore in-memory sqlite database. It's actually created on-disk as well, so this line has to be added
*memory*cache*
# Ignore egg files
*.egg-info
# Ignore pycache files
**/__pycache__
**/mlruns
# Remove arff files
**/*.arff
**/*.zip


# ---------- LOCAL FOLDERS (Abhijit) ----------------------
# Ignore old code
old/*
# Artifacts of OneDrive on computer
*-Suprem-*
# Folders used during local experimentation
experiment/outputs/
local/
# Virtualenv
mlenv/


# ----------- MLEP IGNORES -------------------------------
# This folder is created in each execution. It stores ephemeral execution artifacts. Tracking changes here is unnecessary.
.MLEPServer/
# Keep __init__.py in Sources so that it's accepted as part of Git
!config/Sources/__init__.py
# But ignore all other files -- mainly source encoder files
config/Sources/*
# But ignore RawSource files. Too big for git
config/RawSources/*
# Configuration file generated during execution. Tracking not needed
config/configuration/ExperimentalConfig.json

**/Sources
**/RawSources
**/logfiles

# ------------- OTHER IGNORES ----------------------------
# Ignore data files not used for actual execution. These include local files used to debug some parts of code, but would just pollute the git.
experiment/data/archive/*
experiment/data/*.json
