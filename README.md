# ODIN Readme

DA_GAN.ipynb is for training a DA-GAN. Will need to set up the dataset files.

`mlep_odin_main` is code for ODIN itself. Specifically, the `mlep` folder contains classes for KL-based Delta Band distribution detector (ZonedDistribution class) plus the odin system (MLEPDriftAdaptor class).
